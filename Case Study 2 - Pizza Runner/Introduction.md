## Introduction
<p text-align="justify">Pizza Runner is the second challenge in Danny Ma's 8weeksqlchallenge. This is a great project to work on to practice SQL skills at beginner & intermediate levels. There were some questions in the second half of the brief that I found to be challenging 
and higher than beginner level. But, overall, I really enjoyed working on the questions. It requires a good deal of analytical thinking as well as technical skills, to navigate through the schema & extract the answers for the business questions. The project also helps to understand what kind of questions an analyst needs to ask in order to better the business & make data-driven decisions for the business.</p>
