#### :clipboard: Project Brief

This is the third case study of Dannys 8weeksqlchallenge. This dataset is from a subscription based startup business **Foodie-Fi** that streams food videos & cooking shows from all over the world. They sell both monthly as well as annual plan of subscriptions to their customers.The overarching aim of this analysis is to answer business questions that can help the business make future decisions on new investments and features and ensure that these decisions are data-driven & leverage the power of business intelligence for growth.
The dataset currently contains two tables: plans & subscriptions.
More information about the tables can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/).

As mentioned in the project brief [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/) , this case study is split into an initial data understanding question before diving straight into data analysis questions before finishing with 1 single extension challenge.

#### :tv: Customer Journey
From the sample 'subscriptions' table data, it can observed that most customers opt with the 'pro monthly' plan after a trial period.
